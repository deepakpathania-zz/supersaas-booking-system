# supersaas-booking-system
A booking system made by implementing the API of SuperSaas and python's request module, integrated with flask. Id and password both default to admin for now and the booking page requires a prior login. It lets you book rooms/conference halls which once booked are not available to other use for the duration of the booking. Multiple users can book at the same time like for signing up for a class by making small changes in the configure section of SuperSaas. Read it's documentation for more. Feel free to contribute, merge requests would be pulled if they seem fit.
